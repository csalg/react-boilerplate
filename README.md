This is just a repository to reduce boilerplate.

Libraries:
- antd and antd icons
- styled components and icons
- axios
- json-server
- react-toastify
- jwt-decode

There is also a Dockerfile used for the production build. (I don't see the point of having one for development)

Lastly, I like to use makefiles instead of build and run scripts, so there is a Makefile.
